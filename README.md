# Movies Project (React)

Continuing to develop my knowledge of the React framework and typescript. This time with more fun back-end stuff and an attempt to improve my ability to write tests for React components.

This application uses React for its front-end and the back-end is a combination of Firestore for its non-relational database and my own custom ExpressJS API relay hosted on glitch. Hurray!
